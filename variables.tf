A map of DNS records to create. The map key is deliberately arbitrary to avoid issues where map keys maybe unknown at plan time.

- `name` - The name of the managed subdomain.
- `type` - The type of the record (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.).
- `content` - The content of the record.
- `proxied` - (Optional) Whether the entry is served using Cloudflare's proxy. May cause compatibility issues if set to true. Defaults to false.
